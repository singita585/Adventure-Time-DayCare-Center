            <td>Toddlers will use their senses to explore the world around them.  In math, they will learn how to identify their body parts, name objects, put simple puzzles together, and build blocks. In science, they will learn about the five senses, learn about animals and plants, and observe the weather.</td>
            <td>Children continue their journey of exploration and discovery in our pre-kindergarten program. Teachers help them apply their developing literacy and math skills through purposeful, planned learning experiences. Lesson plans allow children to learn from their teachers and from interactions with other children.</td>
            <td>Students who attend the school age program will get assistance in their homework.  In addition, they will enjoy extra curricular activities that occur after-school throughout the year.</td>
