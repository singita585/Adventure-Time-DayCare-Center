        <p class="sentence about"> At Adventure Time Daycare we believe that every child is capable of excellence.
          That is why we are committed to pursuing and maintaining our status as an
          accredited daycare center. By seeking national accreditation, you know
          that Trusted Friends is striving to give your family the very
          best daycare experience.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">What is Accreditation?</h2>
        <p class="sentence">Every daycare center must meet the state's minimum license requirements.
          We go beyond that. When a daycare center is awarded national accreditation
          they are meeting a higher standard that demonstrates its expertise in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Classroom Management</li>
          <li>Curriculum Development</li>
          <li>Health and Safety</li>
          <li>Parental Support</li>
          <li>Community Involvement</li>
          <li>Teacher Certification</li>
          <li>Administrative Oversight</li>
          <li>Financial Statements</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="sentence">Our commitment to accreditation gives you assurance we provide a positive
          educational experience for your child.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">How does Accreditation Work?</h2>
        <p class="sentence">Every other year we go through an intense review by recognized and esteemed
          national accreditation agencies. Their positive reports (available for
          inspection) confirm that we are providing a clean, safe, and positive
          environment for our children. Accreditation verifies that our teachers are
          qualified and fully engaged in giving our children a first-class educational
          experience.</p>
        <p class="sentence">Once we've completed the entire accreditation self-study process, trained
          professionals from our accrediting agencies conduct on-site visits to
          validate our compliance with national early childhood education standards.
          But accreditation doesn't just take place every two years. It's an ongoing
          process of self-evaluation, discussion, and parental reviews.</p>
        <p class="sentence">We encourage parents to help us improve our center and become better stewards for
          their children. You can part of the accreditation process as we work together
          to make Trusted Friends a great neighborhood center.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Who Provides Accreditation?</h2>
        <p class="sentence">There are several national organizations that provide accreditation services.
          Who a center chooses for oversight is important. Trusted Friends pursues national
          accreditation from three of the most
          respected national early childhood accreditation agencies:</p>
